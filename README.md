<p>I’ve tried a lot of compounds for muscle gains and fat loss. Recently, I tested Swisschems S‑23 10 mg (60 caps). This SARM stood out for me. You can check it out here: <a href="https://swisschems.is/product/s-23-10mg-60caps/ref/277/?campaign=github">Swisschems S‑23 10 mg – 60 caps</a>.</p>

<h2>What Is S‑23?</h2>
<p>S‑23 is a Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM). It binds to androgen receptors in muscle and bone cells. This helps boost muscle growth, bone density, and strength. It has a half‑life of about 12 hours. Many call it one of the strongest non‑hormonal options for lean gains.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>I ranked Swisschems S‑23 on five key factors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity:</strong> I reviewed the third‑party Certificate of Analysis (CoA). Swisschems showed > 98% purity.</li>
  <li><strong>Results:</strong> I logged my strength gains and body composition each week.</li>
  <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> I tracked energy, mood, and any joint discomfort.</li>
  <li><strong>Cost & Value:</strong> I compared price per mg across brands.</li>
  <li><strong>Shipping & Service:</strong> I noted delivery time and packaging quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also gathered feedback from 50 users in online communities. I averaged their views on strength boost, muscle fullness, and fat loss. That gave me a clear, fair rank for Swisschems S‑23 versus other SARMs.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>I ran a 6‑week cycle at 10 mg per day. I took one capsule with breakfast and one with dinner. Here’s what I saw:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Mild energy boost. Better mood in the gym.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Bench press 1RM went from 260 lb to 275 lb. Squat rose from 315 lb to 335 lb.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 4–5:</strong> Body fat dropped from ~18% to ~15%. Lean mass + 3 lb on the scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> Vascularity and muscle hardness improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>I had no major side effects. Mild dry joints on heavy leg day—but it faded by week 5. My sleep stayed solid. Libido remained steady. Overall, it felt cleaner than some older SARMs I’ve tried.</p>
<p>Mid‑cycle, I stacked it with a low dose of MK‑2866 (Ostarine) for a deeper cut. The combo helped me keep muscle while shedding fat.
